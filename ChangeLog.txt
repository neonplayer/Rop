ROP r5:

	WARNING: You will need to run rop rc5 with mopengine with the "teamgame" gamemode for it to work properly.
  
- Major weapon, enemy, balance, sfx rework! (too big to list)
- Added rop_effects. settng it to 0 or false will remove most special effects.
- Added colored monster names. (now if you mouse over a monster as a puppetmaster all names won't be red anymore)
- Puppetmasters can now toggle floorhugger mode by pressing reload. (this makes going through walls eaiser, but prevents you from flying.)

- Removed reloading
- Generally made marine stronger
- Added weapon sprites for chaingunner, arachno-sentinel, spidermastermind, double chaingunner, mancubus, hectebus, cyberdemon and the wolfenstein ss.
